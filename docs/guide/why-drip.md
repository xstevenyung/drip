# Why Drip?

Drip is a full-stack framework build on top of giants' shoulders,
[Deno Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) + [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

## The missing fullstack framework for Deno

Coming from Ruby on Rails and Laravel, I always felt like JS was missing a
**true** full-stack framework.

We saw a surge of new framework filling in the gap like
[Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com/) and [Redwood.js](https://redwoodjs.com/).

Today, we truly believe that Deno is ready for prime time and provide amazing
tools for full-stack application.

Drip is putting together all the tools available in Deno for a complete
full-stack experience which focus all on DX and speed above everything else and
rely on amazing company like The Deno Company and Supabase to scale your
project.

## Embracing web standard

While [Remix](https://remix.run/) paved that way with embracing web standard,
Drip is pushing it even further by building on top of Deno follow the browser
API.

We want and always will choose to follow this path.

## What is it not made for?

Drip is focus on MPA (Multi Page App) and server app rather than SPA. While it's
not impossible to create anything in Drip, you will be better off choosing
another specific framework if you need client-side routing.
