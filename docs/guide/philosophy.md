# Philosophy

## Highly opinionated

Drip is trying to bring high opinion to Deno by providing a full set of tools.
From experiencing first hand with framework like Ruby on Rails and Laravel, we
truly believe that making great choice for the stack will increase velocity and
development speed without sacrificing DX and developer happiness.

## Build with battle-tested tech

The Node.js ecosystem is very interesting because it is so unopinionated. It
leads to people experimenting and sometimes finding new improved ways to do
something.

The sad reality is that without money, project tend to run on the back of good
welling developer. We choose our tech on sustainable projects without
sacrificing implementing new improvements to follow the tech choices that make
senses to our initial goal. Limit developer overhead and provide the best DX
possible.

That's why we choose Supabase and Deno Fresh, both Open Source backed companies
which will still be here 20 years from now.
