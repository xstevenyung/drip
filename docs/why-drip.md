# Why Drip?

Drip is a full-stack framework build on top of giants' shoulders,
[Deno Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) + [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).

## Why Drip?

If you tried Fresh, you probably know that Deno is great but Deno suffers from a
lot of hoops to jump through to reach proper productivity for full-stack
application.

Drip is trying to fill in the gap by putting together a set of comprehensive
tools to get back that productivity and leverage Deno to the fullest.

Drip decided to build around Supabase for a few reasons:

- Open Source
- Great at boosting people productivity right from the start
- Client fully compatible with Deno
- Deno as a first class citizen for
  [Supabase functions](https://supabase.com/edge-functions) feature which mean
  sharable code across all your app
