# Installation

## Before we start...

Drip is built on two core components, Deno Fresh and Supabase.

To run your first Drip project, you will need a few things install:

- [Deno 1.24.1](https://deno.land/#installation)
- [Supabase CLI](https://github.com/supabase/cli) (recommanded but required only
  if you want to run Supabase locally)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (recommanded but required only if you want
  to run Supabase locally)
